This is a simple Node.js project 🎟️ that lets you upload files using Multer. I used Express as the backend framework and EJS for rendering the frontend. When you upload a file, it gets stored in a local uploads folder with a unique timestamp-based filename. 

I’ve set up Multer with custom storage config, handled form submissions with multipart/form-data, and added a basic UI with an upload button. Just a fun way to understand how file uploads work in Node.js.
